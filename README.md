# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

A console-based Java SE application to manage campus records such as students, courses, enrollments, grades, transcripts, and file operations.  
Built as a **Java SE standalone application**, demonstrating OOP principles, design patterns, exception handling, Streams, recursion, and CLI workflows.

# Questions Given In the Statement
## Evolution Of Java
1995: Java 1.0 released by Sun Microsystems ("write once, run anywhere").
1998 (Java 2 - J2SE): Introduced Swing, Collections Framework.
2004 (Java 5): Generics, Enums, Autoboxing, Annotations.
2011 (Java 7): Try-with-resources, NIO.2 file APIs.
2014 (Java 8): Streams API, Lambdas, default methods.
2017 (Java 9): Module system (JPMS).
2021+ (Java 17 LTS): Records, sealed classes.
Ongoing: Switch expressions, pattern matching, Project Loom (virtual threads).

## Java ME vs SE vs EE
### Java ME (Micro Edition)
Designed for small, resource-constrained devices.
Used in feature phones (pre-Android) and embedded systems like sensors.
Provides a cut-down set of APIs and a smaller JVM footprint.
Example: Mobile apps for old-school Nokia devices.

### Java SE (Standard Edition)
The core Java platform for general-purpose development.
Includes APIs for OOP, Collections, File I/O, Streams, multithreading, etc.
Used for desktop applications, command-line tools, small to medium server applications.
Example: Our Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) project is built on Java SE.

### Java EE (Enterprise Edition, now Jakarta EE)
Extends Java SE with enterprise-level features.
Adds support for Servlets, JSP, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JPA, messaging (JMS), and Web Services.
Targeted at large-scale, distributed, server-side applications (e.g., banking software, e-commerce platforms).
Example: A large university portal with web-based course registration.

## JDK/JRE/JVM

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
The engine that runs Java bytecode.
Converts compiled .class files into machine instructions specific to your OS/CPU.
Provides features like automatic memory management (Garbage Collection), security (sandboxing), and platform independence ‚Äî ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anywhere.‚Äù
Every Java program runs inside a JVM. Without it, your .class files are just useless bytecode.

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
The package to run Java applications.
Includes the JVM + a set of standard libraries (core APIs) like java.util, java.io, java.net, etc.
Suitable for end-users who just want to execute Java programs (not write/compile them).
Think of it as the ‚Äúplayer‚Äù needed to run Java applications.

### JDK (Java Development Kit)
The full development kit for Java programmers.
Includes everything from the JRE (JVM + libraries) plus developer tools such as:
javac ‚Üí the compiler that turns .java files into .class bytecode.
javadoc ‚Üí generates documentation.
javap ‚Üí disassembler for debugging bytecode.
Debuggers, jar packagers, etc.
Required if you are writing or developing Java applications.
In other words, JDK = JRE + development tools.
